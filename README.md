# Index Page 
1. I began linking the style sheets for Boostrap + Bootswatch Theme + Custom Style Sheet.
2. I then made the nav bar and footer using Boostrap Components.
3. I then created the new pages (i.e. My Work and Contact) and linked to to the appropiate nav elements.
4. Continuing on the Index page, I created a carousel displaying my "featured work". I sized the images a bit smaller to allow the navigation arrows to be seen clearly.
